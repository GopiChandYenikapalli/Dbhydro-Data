# Dbhydro-Data
DBHYDRO is the South Florida Water Management District's corporate environmental database that stores hydrologic, meteorologic, hydrogeologic and water quality data. This database is the source of historical and up-to-date environmental data for the 16-county region covered by the District.

The DBHYDRO Browser allows you to search, using one or more criteria, and to generate a summary of the data from the available period of record. You can then select data sets of interest and have the time series data dynamically displayed on your screen in tables or graphs. You can also download data to your computer for later use.

In 2021, SFWMD released the new tool called DBHYDRO Insights to make data more easily accessible to the public and stakeholders. 

Please Note: As the SFWMD continues to modernize our applications, DBHYDRO Insights will replace DBHYDRO Browser in the future. Start using DBHydro Insights to learn and familiarize yourself with the webpage. Training guide videos will be available soon. If you have any questions, comments, want to report an issue, or have a specialized request that needs assistance, please contact DataRequests@sfwmd.gov.
